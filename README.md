# addressBook
//You will implement an online address book and compare the use of a binary search tree and a bucket hash structure by implementing both for the design of the address book.

A.  Develop a hash table data structure from the ground up that does not use any of the data structure classes and that includes the following:
 

Note: For all insertions, deletions, and look-ups, the suggestion is to apply an upper case function to convert all letters in both the first and last name to upper case and concatenate to form a single name string.
 

1.  An insertion function that takes the following components as input and that inserts the data element into the hash table:

●   first name

●   last name

●   e-mail address

●   phone number

2.  A deletion function that takes the following components as input and that deletes the corresponding data element from the hash table:

●   first name

●   last name

3.  A look-up function that takes the following components as input and that returns the corresponding data element:

●   first name

●   last name

4.  Implementation of 13 buckets in the bucket hash structure.
 

Note: The hash function used for the hash table may call the Java native method hashCode() as part of its implementation.
 

B.  Develop a tree data structure that does not use of any of the data structure classes and that includes the following:
 

Note: For all insertions, deletions, and look-ups, the suggestion is to apply an upper case function to convert all letters in both the first and last name to upper case, and concatenate to form a single name string.
 

1.  An insertion function that takes the following components as input and that inserts the data element into the tree:

●   first name

●   last name

●   e-mail address

●   phone number

2.  A deletion function that takes the following components as input and that deletes the data element from the tree:

●   first name

●   last name

3.  A look-up function that takes the following components as input and that returns the data element from the tree:

●   first name

●   last name
 

C.  Develop an application that tests the following functions:
 

Note: Applications copied from another student or other source may not be submitted and are not eligible for passing the assessment.
 

1.  insertion function for the hash table

2.  deletion function for the hash table

3.  look-up function for the hash table

4.  insertion function for the tree data structure

5.  deletion function for the tree data structure

6.  look-up function for the tree data structure
 

D.  Use the attached test cases to verify that the hash table and tree data structure run correctly by providing one screenshot that demonstrates successful test execution for each of the following:
 

Note: Test execution screenshots copied from another student or other source may not be submitted and are not eligible for passing the assessment.
 

1.  insert function for the hash table

2.  delete function for the hash table

3.  look-up function for the hash table

4.  insert function for the tree data structure

5.  delete function for the tree data structure

6.  look-up function for the tree data structure
 

E.  Submit a zip file that includes the following:

●   all of your .java and .class files

●   all screenshots of successful test execution from part D

●   comments on all Java code that are clear enough for another person to understand your code

●   a prefix of your initials on all comments
